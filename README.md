# Path-visualizer


Step-by-Step Instructions to Use the Visualizer
🎯 Step 1: Set the Start Point
Left-click on any white cell — it will turn green.

This is your start node.

🛑 Step 2: Set the End Point
Left-click on another white cell — it will turn red.

This is your end node.

🚧 Step 3: Draw Walls (Obstacles)
Left-click on any number of other white cells — they turn black.

These represent obstacles (walls that the algorithm must go around).

🤖 Step 4: Choose Algorithm
Press:

1 to choose BFS

2 to choose A*
(You’ll see confirmation in the terminal like: “Switched to A*”)

🏃 Step 5: Run the Algorithm
Press SPACEBAR.

The algorithm starts:

Blue: Visited/explored nodes

Purple: Open nodes (in queue for A*)

Yellow: The final shortest path

🔁 Step 6: Reset the Grid
Press C to clear the entire grid and start over.
